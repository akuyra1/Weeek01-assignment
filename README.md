# Weeek01-assignment
Assignment for week 01


(Required)
ðŸŽ¯ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
    - I managed to meet all requirements as far as i can tell, to create simple landing page.


ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?
    - 1) Wanted to add more pictures to the gallery, more text and headings with neat layout in mobile screen size, but then the layouts and possitioning of elements started to become messy.
    - 2) Wasn't able to keep everything responsive and looking aesthetic when I started adding more content.


ðŸŽ¯ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    - 1) With more images it became harder to keep them in the gallery container the way i wanted, if you shrink window size to minimum then the images push upwards and downwards and goes under the text of other elements. 
    - 2) Was struggling with layout of my content with flexbox when I started to add more content, background images and text started to bleed into areas I didn't expect. Was struggling with layouts and possitioning the most, especially when you have to keep everything responsive for different screen sizes. 
    - 3) Main points of struggle was layouts, position(relative/absolute), heights and widths, flexbox layouts.
